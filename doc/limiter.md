# Slope Limiters

The slope limiter plays an importrant role in suppressing the spurious numerical oscillations.
They can be written in different equivalent forms and could be equivalent to the correspoding flux limiters.
Most of them are derived strictly for a single nonlinear conservation equation or constant coefficient equations in 1D space.
While for nonlinear conservative equations, slope limiters lack strict theoretical proof.
That might be why sometimes they are not so reliable.

AMRVAC provide tens of limiters to reconstruct data at cell face.
Most of them are applied for finite volume methods.
Therefore, take care when using them in combination with finite difference schemes, especially for asymmetric ones.
Most limiters in mod_limiter.t could be found in Reference [1].

In the current version, limiters could be chosen from the following 19 presets.

'minmod', 'superbee': MINMOD and SUPERBEE are both classic second-order symmetric TVD limiters. They could be found in most text books or review paper, for example, Reference [1-3]. MINMOD, a.k.a. MINBEE or MINA, might be the most diffusive limiter. While SUPERBEE, or sometimes known as SUPERA, is a little bit sharp compared with other second-order limiters. Another similar limiter in the same family is ULTRABEE, which is not implemneted in our code.

'woodward': WOODWARD, a.k.a. double MINMOD limiter or MONOTONIZED CENTRAL(MC) limiter, is also a second-order symmetric TVD limiter which could be found in Reference [4-5]. Should play a better balance than MINMOD and SUPERBEE.

'mcbeta': MC_beta limiter is a second-order symmetric TVD limiter with a default beta = 1.4. Some other usually used values could be 1.5 (in the H-AMR code) or 1.9 (in the KORAL code). In principle, this beta could be changed from 1 to 2. If beta = 1, it will reduce to the MINMOD limiter and if beta = 2, it will reduce to the WOODWARD limiter. It is also proposed in Reference [4].

'vanleer': A classic and widely used second-order symmetric TVD limiter named after Prof. van Leer. Its performance should be comparable with the WOODWARD limiter. First propsed in Reference [6].

'albada': Also a classic second-order symmetric TVD limiter. Similar with the VANLEER limiter but smoother. See Reference [7] for details if you have access to this book. Note that delta^2 is set to be 1.d-12 in our code to avoid clipping smooth extrema. You can lower this value to, for example, 1.d-42 for current double precision limit to reduce the diffusion. However, a better idea to set delta^2 is to make it proportional to (delta x)^3, as we can see in the settings of VENKATAKRISHNAN limiter.

'koren': A third-order asymmetric TVD limiter. See Reference [8] for details. Cost less resource than CADA3 but more diffusive as a third-order limiter.

'cada', 'cada3': Second-order and third-order asymmetric TVD limiter proposed in Reference [9], a.k.a. LIMO or LIMO3. For the third-order one, it seems to perform better than KOREN limiter as shown in Reference [9]. Thus, this limiter is recommended for when choosing third-order limiters.

'venk': The famous VENKATAKRISHNAN limiter is popular in unstructured meshes. It is a little bit similar with the VANALBADA limiter, see Reference [10] for details. This limiter claimed to keep a better balance between accuracy and oscillations, and thus can provide some more details than other second-order limtiters. The parameter K, as mentioned in their paper, is set to be 0.3. Other values like 1 or 10 are also widely used in other literatures.

'ppm': A four-point centered stencil third-order limiter stands for the Piecewise Parabolic Method. See Reference [11] for details and see the references in mod_ppm.t for the implement of this method. Sometimes, it would be time-consuming.

'mp5': A high order (fifth-order) five-point Monolicity Preserving limiter, see Reference [12] for details. MP5 can provide more details than other limiters provided in AMRVAC, but since this MP property cannot prevent small oscillations, even with small CFL number(0.4 or 0.2), it will crash in many cases.

'wenojs3', 'wenojs5i', 'wenojs5r': The classic WENO or Weighted Essentially Non(-)oscillatory Scheme. Check Reference [13] for the original idea of this scheme. The so-called classic WENO or WENO-JS scheme is from Reference [14], who modified it into a more practical way. 'wenojs3', 'wenojs5i', 'wenojs5r' standfor third-order and fifth-order WENO-JS scheme, respectively. In principle, as mentioned in Reference [15], the coefficients named 'reconstruction' should be used here, which corresponds to 'wenojs5r'. However, we note that in some other codes, e.g., ECHO (see Reference [16]) another set of coefficients, which is named 'interpolation' in Reference [15], is used. Therefore, we also provide this set of coefficients, namely, 'wenojs5i'. Tests till now failed to show which variation is better. More tests might be needed. While for the third-order WENO-JS, coefficients for reconstruction and interpolation should be the same. Although the WENO scheme will allow sort of oscillation, it performs to be more diffusive than other third-order or fifth-order, and thus robust in many cases.

'wenoz5i', 'wenoz5r': fifth-order WENO-Z scheme, see Reference [17] for details. One variation of the classic WENO scheme which is innovated by WENO-M but more efficient than WENO-M. It claims to perform better at critical points than WENO-JS, but is not as robust as WENO-JS in some extrme cases.

'wenozp5i', 'wenozp5r': fifth-order WENO-Z+ scheme, see Reference [18] for details. An improved version of WENO-Z.
